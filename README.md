Practice repository

Hi! My name is Jesse and I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I can become a web developer. I like playing the guitar and making some awesome riffs, as well as learning as much as I can about web development. \m/ 

Developers,designers and writers use branches for keeping bug fixes and featured work separate from the master(production) branch when a change is ready they merge their branch into master.

The commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand the changes you made and why.
